# Sonar--Prediction
Developed a logistic regression model with polynomial feature transformation to enhance predictive accuracy on sonar data.
Sonar Data Prediction with Logistic Regression
This project involves developing a logistic regression model to predict sonar data outcomes using polynomial feature transformation. The goal is to improve prediction accuracy on sonar data by leveraging advanced feature engineering techniques.

# Project Overview
# Objective: Enhance the accuracy of sonar data predictions using a logistic regression model with polynomial features.
# Key Techniques:
Polynomial feature transformation to capture non-linear relationships.
StandardScaler for feature normalization.
Stratified train-test split for robust model evaluation.
# Files
# Data set is taken from kaggle
logistic_regression_model.py: Python script implementing the logistic regression model.
